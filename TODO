** Porting
* Change bottom left clock to "offline" "psu off" its redundant in clock mode and the offline on the top looks weird
* Display off is missing, maybe just LED pin on any digital pin or some fet between?
* Frames/Flickering ... maybe every function is responsible for the cleaning itself is a possibility!?
* Add Bitcoin to configuration webpage
* Weather font is missing and also the whole screen isn ready yet

** Features
* Readd screen3 with dimensions, filament info and foo
* Remove bitcoin completely?
* Make colors of ui customizable in webinterface (background, ui, text, ...)
* Maybe some fonts choosable from a list in webinterface?
* Current Z-Height would be wonderful, but cant find in octoprint api!
